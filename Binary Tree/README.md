## About program
Binary search tree storing values of some type (type: e.g. car, building, watch). The comparison algorithm is delivered in the form of a Comparable or Comparator interface. Two such algorithms based on these two interfaces. Algorithms are non-obvious - they are not based solely on numbers, dates or alphabetical order. The solution takes into account:
- generating a sample tree consisting of at least 30 elements in accordance with the given sorting rules resulting from the Comparable or Comparator algorithm
- creating an empty tree,
- adding / removing an element to / from a tree,
- listing in order of increasing content of the tree.
## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
